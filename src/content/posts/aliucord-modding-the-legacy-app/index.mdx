> "Where can I download BetterDiscord for Android?"

Back in early 2021, not many Discord client mods existed for phone users. Even though there was multiple Desktop mods,
such as BetterDiscord and PowerCord, only a couple existed for phone users, and they were all very primitive due to
the way they functioned.

The ones I can recall that were popular at that time were:

- [CutTheCord] (*feature limited*)
- [Treecord] (*dead*-ish)
- Bluecord (*closed source, author has created malware before*)

# Smali patching

All 3 of the aforementioned worked in the same way, smali patches, making development extremely slow and limited in
complexity. The way smali patches work is, using something like [ApkTool], firstly you disassemble the app into an IR
called smali. Think assembly but instead for Java on Android. Next you modify the smali to add your functionality,
run a diff utility to document the changes you did, and reassemble into a functional apk.

For reference, here's an example that adds a simple log statement to the following snippet:

```diff
  int square(int var1) {
+ 	System.out.println("squaring: " + var1);
  	return var1 * var1;
  }
```

Equivalent smali changes:

```diff
+ sget-object v0, Ljava/lang/System;->out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
+ new-instance v1, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
+ invoke-direct {v1}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;-><init>()V
+ const-string v2, "squaring: "
+ invoke-virtual {v1, v2}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->append(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
+ move-result-object v1
+ invoke-virtual {v1, p1}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->append(I)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
+ move-result-object v1
+ invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->toString()Ljava/lang/String;
+ move-result-object v1
+ invoke-virtual {v0, v1}, Ljava/io/PrintStream;->println(Ljava/lang/String;)V
  mul-int p1, p1, p1
  return p1
```

As you can see from the one line example, this approach is extremely time-consuming and overcomplicates even the
smallest of changes. While some projects have worked around this by writing as much code as possible separately and
merging it into the APK later (the Vanced/ReVanced approach), looking at the codebase is like staring at a
photo of SCP-096 (you're gonna die).
Is there a way to modify methods dynamically at runtime with code we compile from source?

# Hooking

The main idea behind "hooking" is to be able to dynamically hook methods (run code before/after) at runtime without
requiring you to modify the actual source code.
[Frida] exists to do this, but it's too complex for what we need and more focused on debugging.
Xposed exists, but this is before the [LSPatch] era, and as such it needs root which only a minority of people have.

Let's take a look at [LSPosed], a Xposed implementation anyway.
Firstly, it relies on a [Magisk] (root framework) module to inject itself into the zygote, which is the root process
for all running applications. Skipping a few details, it loads [LSPlant], a hooking library into the process and loads
any registered Xposed modules. Such modules can then use LSPlant through the Xposed API to hook methods in the target
application just by name.

Here's one such module that changes how the clock is displayed in the built-in *SystemUI* Android app, which handles
your Android "desktop environment".

```java
public class RedClock implements IXposedHookLoadPackage {
	public void handleLoadPackage(LoadPackageParam lpparam) throws Throwable {
		if (!lpparam.packageName.equals("com.android.systemui")) return;
		
		findAndHookMethod(
			"com.android.systemui.statusbar.policy.Clock", // Qualified class name
			lpparam.classLoader, // Application classloader
			"updateClock", // Hook all with this method name
			new XC_MethodHook() {
				// Run after method
				@Override
				protected void afterHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {
					TextView tv = (TextView) param.thisObject; // Get "this"
					tv.setText(tv.getText().toString() + " :)"); // Adds a smiley to the clock
					tv.setTextColor(Color.RED); // Makes the clock red
				}
			}
		);
	}
}
```

To be clear, LSPlant itself does not require root, as every instance of Dalvik
(the Java VM on Android, later replaced by ART) is independent and can freely modify itself/the process.
As such, libraries such as [LSPlant], [Pine], [SandHook], [epic], and [YAHFA] all modify the underlying ART data
that represent runtime methods in order to hook them.
More on how this works in this chinese [article] with a [translation].
It's like black magic really, I still don't fully understand it.

So why not use LSPlant directly? Well there are a few obstacles. For one, a more complicated build process
is needed in order to fit all the necessary components together. Next, we need something to compile code down
to dex bytecode (Java IR for ART). And lastly, we need to modify the APK enough in order to load LSPlant itself and
the rest of our external code, to avoid repackaging the entire thing on any minuscule change.

We eventually solved this with the development of the following projects:

- [Aliucord Manager](#aliucord-manager) ([Github](https://github.com/Aliucord/AliucordManager))
    - This is a separate app that repackages a Discord APK on the users phone in order to add LSPlant and the injector.
    - Also serves as a way to avoid DMCA for distributing APKs.
- [Aliuhook](#aliuhook) ([Github](https://github.com/Aliucord/hook))
    - This is a wrapper around the native LSPlant C++ API in order to provide a partial Xposed-style Java API.
- [Aliucord Injector](#aliucord-injector) ([Github](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/tree/main/Injector))
    - Initializes LSPlant / other low level things
    - This is added into the APK to override a Discord method that is close to startup, in order to load Core.
- [Aliucord Core](#aliucord-core) ([Github](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/tree/main/Aliucord))
    - This is the "actual" place where modding starts.
    - It loads external plugins, initializes other utility patches, and adds bugfixes
- Aliucord Gradle Plugin ([Github](https://github.com/Aliucord/gradle-plugin))
    - This is a gradle plugin that is used solely for the build process in development.
    - Builds plugins, core, injector into the necessary format
        - Plugins & Core into a zip containing a manifest & code compiled to dex
        - Injector into an AAR containing dex to be used in manager

# Aliucord Manager

<div className="flex gap-2">
    <MDXImage src={img_manager_2} alt="Manager installer screen"/>
    <MDXImage src={img_manager_1} alt="Manager home screen"/>
</div>

The first time a user touches your project they must have a good experience otherwise they'll just give up.
Manager was designed with this in mind, making the installation process as simple as possible if everything goes right.
Unfortunately because of Androidâ„¢ and other differences between ROMs there's a ton of issues especially with how
obscure what we're trying to do is. MIUI is the biggest offender with its "MIUI Optimizations" that breaks everything
from installing an APK to hooking to literally anything on earth, and is a huge pain in the ass.

Assuming everything goes right however, after the user grants the necessary prompted permissions,
the repacking process is hidden under a single button and then installation happens seamlessly.

1. Download a base Discord v126.21 (126021) APK through our proxy, redirecting to an APK mirror site.
2. Download precompiled LSPlant, Core, Injector, and Kotlin builds through Aliucord's maven.
3. Since APKs are just a zip, open the APK using a zip library and:
    - Add in the LSPlant native library
    - Add in .dex containing Kotlin
    - Add in .dex containing Injector [<sup>[dex priority]</sup>](#dex-priority)
    - [Modify AndroidManifest.xml] in order to:
        - Change app & package name
        - Add additional permissions
        - Change min sdk version, etc...
4. Resign the APK using a key generated on device
5. Install the APK

## DMCA

The best part about this method is that we personally never have to distribute Discord's APKs, which would be
copyright infringement and have the chance of being forced to shut down.
Discord doesn't seem to care a lot about this however as decompilations exist everywhere.
Most famous is probably the [Discord Datamining] repo, which has existed for >3 years and contains thousands of
versions of the desktop client, with Discord not seeming to care.

Even if unlikely, better to be safe than sorry and have a cease & desist in your inbox.

# Aliuhook

There isn't much to say other than Ven made a nice Java wrapper around the LSPlant C++ API.
We actually used [Pine] first before LSPlant existed and eventually switched over after plant became stable enough.

It also handles disabling the [Hidden API Policy](#hidden-api-policy) on Android since it's easier natively.

# Aliucord Injector

This is what initializes Aliuhook (LSPlant) and loads the external Core.

## .dex priority

Dex bytecode inside an APK in contained within .dex files, named `classes.dex` to `classes2.dex` to `classesN.dex`.
You can add any number of dex files, and they will __always__ be loaded in order.
As such, if two dex files contain classes with an identical name, the first one will *always* be processed instead,
and the 2nd one will be discarded.

This quirk is what Injector uses, we found an empty class (`App$a`) that was referenced from the entry point of the
application, running the static initializer block almost instantly. Great!
To clarify, we don't *need* an empty class, but the likelihood of it changing between updates is minimal since it looks
autogenerated by Kotlin, and as such likely won't break. (never did!)
Otherwise, you can replace any class really and just make sure to preserve the original code.

```java
package com.discord.app;
import android.app.Application;
import kotlin.jvm.internal.DefaultConstructorMarker;
	
public class App extends Application {
	public static final App.a Companion = new App.a(null);
	public static final class a {
		public a(DefaultConstructorMarker default) {}
	}
	// ...
}
```

We can now just make an identical class and make the injector be the first `classes.dex`, making it override the
identical class from subsequent dex files. From there, just we can call our injection logic directly.

```java
// This is a class by Discord which conveniently happens to be empty
// Thus it offers an amazing entry point for an injection since we can safely override the class
public final class App$a {
	static {
		InjectorKt.init();
	}

	public App$a(DefaultConstructorMarker defaultConstructorMarker) {}
}
```

## Inlined methods

Due to ART JIT (just-in-time) & AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation, sometimes methods become inlined,
meaning any call sites for a particular method were replaced by the method body itself for additional performance.
This breaks hooking, as hooking modifies the method definition instead.
To avoid this, we disable generating AOT & JIT "profiles" entirely and delete any existing profiles,
sacrificing the performance optimizations for a greater good.

- [Disabling AOT profiles]
- [Pruning AOT profiles]

## Hidden API Policy

Starting in Android 9, Android now restricts which non-SDK APIs you are allowed to use.
This was implemented by literally breaking any references and reflection to such APIs in your app.
However, this is purely an ART restriction and as such can be lifted quite easily.
Despite Google's scary warnings this is a shit "feature" and hidden APIs are really useful for some obscure things I'm
not going to cover here.
Essentially, you have to call `dalvik.system.VMRuntime#setHiddenApiExemptions("L")` and this will disable it app-wide.
But it's not as simple as it seems because that method is behind the Hidden API as well. There are multiple cursed
tricks to get around this, like meta-reflection, JNI, or my favorite and most cursed, [the Unsafe class].

We've used [meta-reflection] and later switched to [calling it natively] instead.

As an example, this also allows you to do dumb shit like this:

```kotlin
patcher.before<TextView>("setText", /* ... */) {
	it.args[0] = "uwu"
}
```

<MDXImage src={img_uwu} alt="Discord UI but every text element is replaced with uwu"/>

# Aliucord Core

This where the actual "mod" part begins. After being downloaded and loaded by Injector,
we start initializing core patches, and other utilities such as logging, a simpler patcher api, and the plugin manager.
If everything goes according to plan then an Aliucord section should appear in settings to configure the mod.
Most of this is uninteresting overall and kind of boilerplate, however this is what plugins interface with.

## Making plugins

With the help of the Aliucord gradle plugin this process is extremely fast since we provide direct references to
Discord code from plugin source code. By utilizing [dex2jar] to convert dex from an apk back into Java ASM we can use
it as reference stubs without actually decompiling. To test, running a single gradle task `pushToAdb` will copy it to
your phone and restart Aliucord nearly instantly, providing a fast way to debug and test changes that smali patching
would have taken forever to do.

This makes patching extremely easy with some neat Kotlin syntax (my favorite language ever):

```kotlin
import com.discord.models.user.CoreUser
import com.discord.stores.StoreUserTyping
	
// Rename everyone to Clyde visually
patcher.instead<CoreUser>("getUsername") { "Clyde" }
	
// Rename a specific user visually
patcher.before<CoreUser>("getUsername") {
	if (id == 343383572805058560L) it.result = "Not Clyde!!";
}
	
// Prevent typing indicators from being sent
patcher.instead<StoreUserTyping>("setUserTyping", Long::class.javaPrimitiveType!!) { null };
```

To find such methods you can either utilize [jadx] or personally my favorite sometimes;
a combination of [dex2jar] + [Vineflower] (formerly known as Quiltflower) in order to decompile Discord.
After doing so, opening it up an IDE and searching for references/abusing Ctrl+F is fairly simple
even if it's time-consuming to find the right way to patch something.

# Postmortem

Is this overcomplicated? Yes. Is it incredibly fragile? Absolutely.

The end goal was reached however, and we have a nice client mod with pretty themes, a saturated list of plugins,
and tons of people that still use it. Even though this version of Discord is now more than a year old
(outdated since August 2022) it's still on life support with the help of people who *despise* the new app built with
React Native. (like me)
